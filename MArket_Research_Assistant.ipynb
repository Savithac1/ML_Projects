        "# Problem Statement\n",
        "Market research is time-intensive, requiring analysts to sift through vast amounts of data to extract relevant insights. This project addresses this challenge by leveraging natural language processing (NLP) and retrieval-based AI to generate structured reports, including industry overviews, key players, market trends, and relevant sources.\n",
